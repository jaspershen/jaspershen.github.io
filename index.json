提供了一个交互式的图形用户界面（GUI），可以在RStudio中或网页浏览器中打开，可以实时地查看和调整不同的颜色方案，并生成相应的R代码。 提供了一些函数和方法，可以对颜色进行转换，混合，插值，排序，分组等操作，并评估颜色方案的可视化效果和可辨识度。 下面我们来看一些colorspace包的使用示例：\n加载colorspace包 首先，我们需要安装并加载colorspace包。如果你还没有安装过colorspace包，可以运行以下代码：\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;colorspace\u0026#34;) 然后，我们可以用library函数加载colorspace包：\nlibrary(colorspace) 查看预定义的颜色方案 colorspace包提供了多种预定义的颜色方案，我们可以用hcl_palettes函数查看它们：\nhcl_palettes() ## HCL palettes ## ## Type: Qualitative ## Names: Pastel 1, Dark 2, Dark 3, Set 2, Set 3, Warm, Cold, Harmonic, Dynamic ## ## Type: Sequential (single-hue) ## Names: Grays, Light Grays, Blues 2, Blues 3, Purples 2, Purples 3, Reds 2, ## Reds 3, Greens 2, Greens 3, Oslo ## ## Type: Sequential (multi-hue) ## Names: Purple-Blue, Red-Purple, Red-Blue, Purple-Orange, Purple-Yellow, ## Blue-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Heat, Heat 2, Terrain, ## Terrain 2, Viridis, Plasma, Inferno, Rocket, Mako, Dark Mint, ## Mint, BluGrn, Teal, TealGrn, Emrld, BluYl, ag_GrnYl, Peach, ## PinkYl, Burg, BurgYl, RedOr, OrYel, Purp, PurpOr, Sunset, ## Magenta, SunsetDark, ag_Sunset, BrwnYl, YlOrRd, YlOrBr, OrRd, ## Oranges, YlGn, YlGnBu, Reds, RdPu, PuRd, Purples, PuBuGn, PuBu, ## Greens, BuGn, GnBu, BuPu, Blues, Lajolla, Turku, Hawaii, Batlow ## ## Type: Diverging ## Names: Blue-Red, Blue-Red 2, Blue-Red 3, Red-Green, Purple-Green, ## Purple-Brown, Green-Brown, Blue-Yellow 2, Blue-Yellow 3, ## Green-Orange, Cyan-Magenta, Tropic, Broc, Cork, Vik, Berlin, ## Lisbon, Tofino 这个函数会返回一个列表，每个元素是一个颜色方案的名称和描述。例如：\n$`Diverging` [1] \u0026#34;Diverging HCL palettes from diverge_hcl\u0026#34; 我们可以看到，有一个叫做Diverging的颜色方案，它是由diverge_hcl函数生成的。我们可以用这个函数来创建一个发散型的颜色方案，例如：\ndiverge_hcl(7, h = c(246, 40), c = 96, l = c(65, 90)) ## [1] \u0026#34;#1FA4FF\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#97BFF3\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#CAD6E9\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E2E2E2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E7D1C5\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E9B18B\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E28912\u0026#34; 这个函数会返回一个长度为7的向量，每个元素是一个十六进制的颜色代码。我们可以用plot函数来查看这个颜色方案：\nscales::show_col(diverge_hcl(7, h = c(246, 40), c = 96, l = c(65, 90))) 我们可以看到，这个颜色方案是由蓝色和红色组成的，中间有一个白色。这种类型的颜色方案适合用来表示数据中存在两个极端或对立的情况。\n类似地，我们可以用其他函数来创建不同类型的颜色方案，例如sequential_hcl, qualitative_hcl等。具体的参数和用法可以参考colorspace包的文档。\n使用交互式图形用户界面 colorspace包还提供了一个交互式的图形用户界面，可以让我们在RStudio中或网页浏览器中打开，可以实时地查看和调整不同的颜色方案，并生成相应的R代码。我们可以用choose_palette函数来启动这个界面：\nchoose_palette() 这个函数会打开一个新的窗口，如下图所示：\n我们可以在左侧的菜单中选择不同的颜色方案类型，例如Sequential, Diverging, Qualitative等。然后，我们可以在右侧的滑动条中调整颜色方案的参数，例如色相，色度，亮度，数量等。我们还可以在下方的选项中选择是否显示颜色名称，是否反转颜色顺序，是否显示颜色条等。我们可以看到，随着我们的调整，中间的图形会实时地更新，显示当前的颜色方案。我们还可以在右下角看到生成这个颜色方案的R代码，方便我们复制和使用。\n这个交互式图形用户界面是一个非常方便和有趣的工具，可以让我们快速地找到合适的颜色方案，并进行微调和优化。\n对颜色进行操作和评估 colorspace包还提供了一些函数和方法，可以对颜色进行转换，混合，插值，排序，分组等操作，并评估颜色方案的可视化效果和可辨识度。例如：\n我们可以用hcl函数将RGB颜色转换为HCL颜色，或者用rgb函数将HCL颜色转换为RGB颜色。 我们可以用mixcolor函数将两种或多种颜色进行混合，得到一个新的颜色。 我们可以用specplot函数将一个颜色方案在不同的颜色空间中进行可视化，比较它们的差异和特点。 我们可以用desaturate函数将一个颜色方案变得更加灰暗，或者用lighten函数将一个颜色方案变得更加明亮。 我们可以用rainbow_hcl函数生成一个类似彩虹的连续型颜色方案，或者用heat_hcl函数生成一个类似热力图的连续型颜色方案。 我们可以用emulateColorBlindness函数模拟不同类型的色盲对颜色方案的感知，评估它们的可辨识度。 这些函数和方法都有详细的文档和示例，可以帮助我们更好地理解和使用colorspace包。\n总结 colorspace包是一个非常强大和实用的R语言扩展包，它可以让我们在不同的颜色空间中进行颜色的转换，选择，操作和评估。colorspace包基于HCL（色相-色度-亮度）颜色模型，这是一种基于人类视觉感知的颜色表示方法，比RGB（红-绿-蓝）或CMYK（青-品红-黄-黑）等常见的颜色模型更加直观和灵活。colorspace包提供了多种预定义的颜色方案，包括连续型（sequential），发散型（diverging）和定性型（qualitative）三种类型，可以根据数据的特点和目的进行选择。colorspace包还提供了一个交互式的图形用户界面（GUI），可以在RStudio中或网页浏览器中打开，可以实时地查看和调整不同的颜色方案，并生成相应的R代码。\n","date":1689819194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692942475,"objectID":"95531f42671b35b1c3630a91aa879b04","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/post/2023-07-19-colorspace/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2023-07-19-colorspace/","section":"post","summary":"颜色是数据可视化中非常重要的一个元素，它可以传达信息，引起注意，增强美感，甚至影响情绪。但是，如何选择合适的颜色方案呢？有没有一种科学的方法，可以帮助我们在众多的颜色中找到最佳的组合呢?","tags":["R

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
