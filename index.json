我们可以看到，有一个叫做Diverging的颜色方案，它是由diverge_hcl函数生成的。我们可以用这个函数来创建一个发散型的颜色方案，例如：\ndiverge_hcl(7, h = c(246, 40), c = 96, l = c(65, 90)) ## [1] \u0026#34;#1FA4FF\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#97BFF3\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#CAD6E9\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E2E2E2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E7D1C5\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E9B18B\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#E28912\u0026#34; 这个函数会返回一个长度为7的向量，每个元素是一个十六进制的颜色代码。我们可以用plot函数来查看这个颜色方案：\nscales::show_col(diverge_hcl(7, h = c(246, 40), c = 96, l = c(65, 90))) 我们可以看到，这个颜色方案是由蓝色和红色组成的，中间有一个白色。这种类型的颜色方案适合用来表示数据中存在两个极端或对立的情况。\n类似地，我们可以用其他函数来创建不同类型的颜色方案，例如sequential_hcl, qualitative_hcl等。具体的参数和用法可以参考colorspace包的文档。\n使用交互式图形用户界面 colorspace包还提供了一个交互式的图形用户界面，可以让我们在RStudio中或网页浏览器中打开，可以实时地查看和调整不同的颜色方案，并生成相应的R代码。我们可以用choose_palette函数来启动这个界面：\nchoose_palette() 这个函数会打开一个新的窗口，如下图所示：\n我们可以在左侧的菜单中选择不同的颜色方案类型，例如Sequential, Diverging, Qualitative等。然后，我们可以在右侧的滑动条中调整颜色方案的参数，例如色相，色度，亮度，数量等。我们还可以在下方的选项中选择是否显示颜色名称，是否反转颜色顺序，是否显示颜色条等。我们可以看到，随着我们的调整，中间的图形会实时地更新，显示当前的颜色方案。我们还可以在右下角看到生成这个颜色方案的R代码，方便我们复制和使用。\n这个交互式图形用户界面是一个非常方便和有趣的工具，可以让我们快速地找到合适的颜色方案，并进行微调和优化。\n对颜色进行操作和评估 colorspace包还提供了一些函数和方法，可以对颜色进行转换，混合，插值，排序，分组等操作，并评估颜色方案的可视化效果和可辨识度。例如：\n我们可以用hcl函数将RGB颜色转换为HCL颜色，或者用rgb函数将HCL颜色转换为RGB颜色。 我们可以用mixcolor函数将两种或多种颜色进行混合，得到一个新的颜色。 我们可以用specplot函数将一个颜色方案在不同的颜色空间中进行可视化，比较它们的差异和特点。 我们可以用desaturate函数将一个颜色方案变得更加灰暗，或者用lighten函数将一个颜色方案变得更加明亮。 我们可以用rainbow_hcl函数生成一个类似彩虹的连续型颜色方案，或者用heat_hcl函数生成一个类似热力图的连续型颜色方案。 我们可以用emulateColorBlindness函数模拟不同类型的色盲对颜色方案的感知，评估它们的可辨识度。 这些函数和方法都有详细的文档和示例，可以帮助我们更好地理解和使用colorspace包。\n总结 colorspace包是一个非常强大和实用的R语言扩展包，它可以让我们在不同的颜色空间中进行颜色的转换，选择，操作和评估。colorspace包基于HCL（色相-色度-亮度）颜色模型，这是一种基于人类视觉感知的颜色表示方法，比RGB（红-绿-蓝）或CMYK（青-品红-黄-黑）等常见的颜色模型更加直观和灵活。colorspace包提供了多种预定义的颜色方案，包括连续型（sequential），发散型（diverging）和定性型（qualitative）三种类型，可以根据数据的特点和目的进行选择。colorspace包还提供了一个交互式的图形用户界面（GUI），可以在RStudio中或网页浏览器中打开，可以实时地查看和调整不同的颜色方案，并生成相应的R代码。\n","date":1689819194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692942475,"objectID":"95531f42671b35b1c3630a91aa879b04","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/post/2023-07-19-colorspace/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2023-07-19-colorspace/","section":"post","summary":"颜色是数据可视化中非常重要的一个元素，它可以传达信息，引起注意，增强美感，甚至影响情绪。但是，如何选择合适的颜色方案呢？有没有一种科学的方法，可以帮助我们在众多的颜色中找到最佳的组合呢?","tags":["R package","Paper"],"title":"如何使用colorspace包选择合适的颜色方案","type":"book"},{"authors":["Sanjay Jain","Liming Pei","Jeffrey M Spraggins","Michael Angelo","Michael P Snyder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691900842,"objectID":"f7105e28b665482c58dce8189427608b","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/publication/advances-and-prospects-for-the-human-biomolecular-atlas-program/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/advances-and-prospects-for-the-human-biomolecular-atlas-program/","section":"publication","summary":"Advances and prospects for the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)","tags":null,"title":"Advances and prospects for the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaotao Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686056400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693808809,"objectID":"5f2ceb702441007bab86c05aca7e13f6","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/talk/2023-asms/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2023-asms/","section":"talk","summary":"Multi-Omics Microsampling for The Profiling of Lifestyle-Associated Changes in Health","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Omics Microsampling for The Profiling of Lifestyle-Associated Changes in Health","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Wei Wei","Nicholas M Riley","Xuchao Lyu","Xiaotao Shen","Jing Guo","Steffen H Raun","Meng Zhao","Maria Dolores Moya-Garzon","Himanish Basu","Alan Sheng-Hwa Tung","Veronica L Li","Wentao Huang","Amanda L Wiggenhorn","Katrin J Svensson","Michael P Snyder","Carolyn R Bertozzi","Jonathan Z Long"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693890515,"objectID":"6bc330066e6a595f9f380941df9764e4","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/publication/organism-wide-cell-type-specific-secretome-mapping-of-exercise-training-in-mice/","publishdate":"2023-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/organism-wide-cell-type-specific-secretome-mapping-of-exercise-training-in-mice/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a significant interest in identifying blood-borne factors that mediate tissue crosstalk and function as molecular effectors of physical activity. Although past studies have focused on an individual molecule or cell type, the organism-wide secretome response to physical activity has not been evaluated.

Our dataset identifies \u003e200 exercise training-regulated cell-type-secreted protein pairs, the majority of which have not been previously reported. Pdgfra-cre-labeled secretomes were the most responsive to exercise training. Finally, we show anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and exercise performance-enhancing activities for proteoforms of intracellular carboxylesterases whose secretion from the liver is induced by exercise

Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts.

The NGLY1 protein catalyzes the first step in protein deglycosylation, a process prerequisite for the cytosolic degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. By performing and combining metabolomics and proteomics profiles, we showed that NGLY1 deficiency induced the activation of immune response, disturbed lipid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and glutathione metabolism. The discovery was further validated by profiling of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which serve as a personalized cellular model of the disease. This study provides new insights into the NGLY1 deficiency pathology and demonstrates that the upregulation of immune response and downregulation of lipid metabolism appear to be important molecular phenotypes of NGLY1 deficiency, together with the dysregulation of amino acid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and diverse signaling pathways, likely causing broad downstream syndromes. Collectively, such valuable multi-omics profiles identified broad molecular associations of potential pathological mechanisms during the onset of NGLY1 deficiency and suggested potential therapeutic targets for researchers and clinicians.","tags":null,"title":"Integration and comparison of multi-omics profiles of NGLY1 deficiency plasma and cellular models to identify clinically relevant molecular phenotypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiali Lv","Jialin Wang","Xiaotao Shen","Jia Liu","Deli Zhao","Mengke Wei","Xia Li","Bingbing Fan","Yawen Sun","Fuzhong Xue","Prof. Zheng-Jiang Zhu","Tao Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693890515,"objectID":"fbe67d7259854f233b03028860283dba","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","section":"publication","summary":"Dear Editor, Endoscopy with iodine staining was widely used for esophageal cancer (EC) screening in high-incidence area. 1, 2 Most endoscopy screening-positive population was found to develop esophageal epithelium lesion, and therefore endured higher risk for developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) than normal population. 3, 4 However, endoscopic screening may be too costly and invasive for large-scale population, and non-invasive biomarkers may be more applicable and cost effective for population-based screening. 5, 6 In this population-based screening study, we aim to identify potential metabolic biomarkers for early screening of ESCC, and establish the optimal early ESCC screening model.

However, few of these studies concerned the whole process of the progression of ESCC. This study aims to explore serum metabolites associated with the progression of ESCC. METHODS: Serum samples from 653 participants (305 normal, 77 esophagitis, 228 LGD, and 43 HGD/ESCC) were examined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was first applied to obtain an overview of the clustering trend for the multidimensional data. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering was then used to screen metabolites with a changing tendency in the progression of ESCC.

To define a high-resolution temporal profile of metabolites during healthy pregnancy, we analyzed the untargeted metabolome of 784 weekly blood samples from 30 pregnant women. Broad changes and a highly choreographed profile were revealed: 4,995 metabolic features (of 9,651 total), 460 annotated compounds (of 687 total), and 34 human metabolic pathways (of 48 total) were significantly changed during pregnancy. Using linear models, we built a metabolic clock with five metabolites that time gestational age in high accordance with ultrasound (R = 0.92). Furthermore, two to three metabolites can identify when labor occurs (time to delivery within two, four, and eight weeks, AUROC ≥ 0.85).

Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 …","tags":null,"title":"Metabolic reaction network-based recursive metabolite annotation for untargeted metabolomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiwei Zhou","Xiaotao Shen","Xi Chen","Jia Tu","Xin Xiong","Zheng-Jiang Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"054b8e089663547f1aedf1f37dd00b22","permalink":"https://jaspershen.github.io/publication/lipidimms-analyzer-integrating-multi-dimensional-information-to-support-lipid-identification-in-ion-mobilitymass-spectrometry-based-lipidomics/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipidimms-analyzer-integrating-multi-dimensional-information-to-support-lipid-identification-in-ion-mobilitymass-spectrometry-based-lipidomics/","section":"publication","summary":"Ion mobility—mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has showed great application potential for lipidomics.

While the use of collision cross-section (CCS) values obtained in ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) effectively increases identification confidence of metabolites, it is restricted by the limited number of available CCS values for metabolites. Here, we demonstrated the use of a machine-learning algorithm called support vector regression (SVR) to develop a prediction method that utilized 14 common molecular descriptors to predict CCS values for metabolites. In this work, we first experimentally measured CCS values (ΩN₂) of ∼400 metabolites in nitrogen buffer gas and used these values as training data to optimize the prediction method. The high prediction precision of this method was externally validated using an independent set of metabolites with a median relative error (MRE) of ∼3%, better than conventional theoretical calculation. Using the SVR based prediction method, a large-scale predicted CCS database was generated for 35 203 metabolites in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). For each metabolite, five different ion adducts in positive and negative modes were predicted, accounting for 176 015 CCS values in total. Finally, improved metabolite identification accuracy was demonstrated using real biological samples.
